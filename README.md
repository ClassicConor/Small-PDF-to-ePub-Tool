# Small-PDF-to-ePub-Tool
Convert chapters within a PDF document to ePub either manually or with LLMs (using Llama 3.1:8b through Ollama)

``` Still a work in progress.```

The main features that need to be added are the ability to convert a PDF to an ePub without LLMs (much more inaccurate), and with LLMs (more accurate, but require a more powerful computer).

I will attempt to add the non-LLM functionality soon, and then the LLM functionality afterwards. Unfortunately my computer is not that powerful, so I will not easily be able to test the functionality of the LLM version to see if it will actually work, even if I know that the code does in fact work.
